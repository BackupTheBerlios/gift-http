---------------------

This is a simple HTTP plugin for giFT (www.giftproject.org)

It simply downloads a singe file from a web server given the url.
No searching is implemented.


Compilation & Installation
--------------------------

First put the sources you got somewhere outside the giFT source tree.

Needed tools to build giFT-Http are as follows:

automake    >= 1.6 (not if you use the tarball release)
autoconf    >= 2.5 (not if you use the tarball release)
libtool     >= 1.4 (not if you use the tarball release)
pkg-config
giFT


Next run './configure' in the top source dir if you are using a TARBALL RELEASE.
Or run './autogen.sh' if you got the sources from CVS.


Mac OS X users should run 
  sh -c 'LIBTOOL=glibtool LIBTOOLIZE=glibtoolize ./configure'
or
  sh -c 'LIBTOOL=glibtool LIBTOOLIZE=glibtoolize ./autogen.sh'
respectively.
(or if use fink to install it, if you have it)

If you have giFT installed in a non-standard location (according to
pkg-config), you must make sure that PKG_CONFIG_PATH is set to the
directory where libgift.pc is located.

For example:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH" (for bash)
or
  setenv PKG_CONFIG_PATH "/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig" (for tcsh)


The next step is to run 'make' and 'make install' which will compile
and install the plugin.

Then add Http to the [main]/plugins line in ~/.giFT/gift.conf,
like so:

old:
	[main]
	plugins = OpenFT:Gnutella

new:
	[main]
	plugins = OpenFT:Gnutella:Http

You may also use a fully qualified path to the plugin filename:
 
	[main]
	plugins = OpenFT:/usr/local/lib/giFT/libHttp.la
 


Common Problems
---------------

As a general rule, if you get errors that aren't mentioned below, first get
fresh sources from cvs before trying anything else. It may be that something
about giFT has changed and we fixed it in cvs but haven't released yet.

Problem:  You put the plugin into the giFT source tree.
Symptoms: During ./autogen.sh you get the error:
          "libtoolize failed to generate ltmain.sh"
Solution: Move the plugin somewhere outside the giFT source tree, or update
	  to the newest cvs version.

Problem:  giFT was not built with ltdl support
Symptoms: *** GIFT-FATAL: couldn't load protocol /usr/lib/giFT/libHttp.la
	  in file : binary does not support this protocol, consider ltdl support
Solution: Make sure libltdl is installed (apt-get install libltdl3-dev in
	  debian) and rm config.cache && ./autogen.sh
