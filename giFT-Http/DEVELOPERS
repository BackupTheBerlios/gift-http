This file is intented for front end developers wishing to make use of
giFT-Http.

To download a file you have to create an ADDSOURCE command for giFT.
Since the plugin doesn't support searching you cannot retrieve the
data for this command from a search result.

An ADDSOURCE command looks like this:

ADDSOURCE
  user (username)
  hash (hash)
  size (filesize)
  url (url)
  save (savefilename)
;

All fields except hash are required for giFT to function properly.

This creates a problem because usually one just has an URL for a
http download.

The username can be set to anything you like so it's not a problem.

However you will have to know the size of the file you're going to
download in advance. This is a limitation in giFT and there is
currently no way around it.

The hash can be left out if you don't want to verify the file after
downloading. Otherwise you can specify an MD5 of the entire file to
verify against.

Please note that the scheme part of the url must exactly match the
plugin name (i.e. "Http", case sensitive). Thus you must modify all
http urls to start with "Http://".
